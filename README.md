# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## About Project
This project demonstrates a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on various features like square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc. The model is built and evaluated using Python and essential data science libraries.

## Overview
Accurately predicting house prices is a crucial application of machine learning in the real estate industry. This project uses a simple yet effective Linear Regression model to predict house prices, aiming to provide a foundation for more complex predictive systems.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Implementation of a Linear Regression model
- Model evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared
